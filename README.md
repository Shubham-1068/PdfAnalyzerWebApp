[![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-Live-brightgreen)](https://pdf-analyzer-web-app.vercel.app)

A web application built with TypeScript for analyzing PDF files.  This application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading PDFs and extracting key information.

## Features

* **Intuitive User Interface:** Upload PDF files easily and navigate the analysis results with a clean, modern interface.
* **Data Extraction:**  Extracts relevant data from PDFs, including (but not limited to): text content, metadata, and potentially more advanced features in future updates.
* **Client-Side Processing:**  Leveraging the power of the browser, the analysis happens directly in the client, ensuring privacy and faster processing for smaller files. (Note: very large files might experience performance limitations).


## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** TypeScript, React (Likely - inferred from common use with web apps)
* **Deployment:** Vercel (Confirmed via `homepage` field)

## Getting Started

While this application is currently deployed and accessible via the link above,  the source code is provided for reference and potential future contributions.  Instructions for local development will be added in a future update.


## Future Development

This project is under active development. Future plans include:

* Expanding data extraction capabilities (tables, images, etc.).
* Implementing server-side processing for larger files.
* Adding advanced analytics and visualization features.
* Improved error handling and user feedback.
